Practicing writing should be good, and is at least 5/7ths of the goal really. I can work past the writers block, and the gripping fear of having my words read, and somewhat permanently committed to page." />

    <p>So, I want to start a blog again. I&rsquo;m still terrified of writing, and I want to write.</p>
<p>So, a somewhat public blog, that almost no one knows about seems a good place to start!
All the better if it doesn&rsquo;t allow comments and is published statically so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about being hacked.</p>
<p>Practicing writing should be good, and is at least 5/7ths of the goal really.
I can work past the writers block, and the gripping fear of having my words read, and somewhat permanently committed to page.
Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll share them, or I&rsquo;ll start anew once past the fear!</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m still trying to work out how to get it to actually appear anywhere other than my own personal machine.
I&rsquo;m trialing out Hugo and the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-kiera/">Kiera</a> theme, and hope to host on github pages. It should be a learning experience it seems.
I imagine I&rsquo;ve wrecked it all so far and will likely have to rip out bits and potentially start over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely going to have to not write on a chromebook keyboard with a stupid sensitive touchpad that keeps reading my palms.</p>
