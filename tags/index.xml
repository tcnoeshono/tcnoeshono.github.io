       <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I want to start a blog again. I&amp;rsquo;m still terrified of writing, and I want to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a somewhat public blog, that almost no one knows about seems a good place to start!
All the better if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow comments and is published statically so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing writing should be good, and is at least 5/7ths of the goal really.
I can work past the writers block, and the gripping fear of having my words read, and somewhat permanently committed to page.
Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll share them, or I&amp;rsquo;ll start anew once past the fear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out how to get it to actually appear anywhere other than my own personal machine.
I&amp;rsquo;m trialing out Hugo and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-kiera/&#34;&gt;Kiera&lt;/a&gt; theme, and hope to host on github pages. It should be a learning experience it seems.
I imagine I&amp;rsquo;ve wrecked it all so far and will likely have to rip out bits and potentially start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to have to not write on a chromebook keyboard with a stupid sensitive touchpad that keeps reading my palms.&lt;/p&gt;
